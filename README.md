# Crohn's Disease Treatment Study

## Overview

This repository contains data and analysis from an experimental study investigating the effects of various treatment strategies on disease progression and gut microbiome composition in children diagnosed with Crohn's disease. The study also includes a control group of healthy children.

## Background

Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease characterized by immune system overactivity against the intestinal microbiome. Treatment options include drug therapy and nutrition-based treatments. The relationship between Crohn's disease and the gut microbiome is complex and still under investigation.

## Experimental Design

### Participants:
- **Crohn's Disease Group**: Children diagnosed with Crohn's disease (active disease).
  - **Treatment Groups**:
    - **antiTNF**: 52 children receiving immune-suppressing drugs.
    - **Exclusive Enteral Nutrition (EEN)**: 22 children receiving nutrition-based treatment with special formulas.
    - **Partial Enteral Nutrition (PEN)**: 16 children receiving a combination of formula and normal nutrition.
- **Non-IBD Control Group**: 26 healthy children.

### Sampling:
- Each child with Crohn's disease was sampled **four times**:
  1. Before treatment initiation.
  2. About a week after treatment initiation.
  3. About a month after treatment initiation.
  4. Two months after treatment initiation.
- Stool samples were collected at each time point for microbiome characterization.
- Disease progression was monitored using Fecal Calprotectin (FCP) tests.

- Healthy children (non-IBD control group) were sampled **once** to characterize the microbiome.

### Treatments:
- Some children with Crohn's disease also received antibiotics and steroids as part of their treatment regimen.

## Data Analysis

- The repository includes data analysis scripts and results focusing on:
  - Disease progression among treatment groups.
  - Changes in gut microbiome composition over time.
  - Comparison with healthy children.
